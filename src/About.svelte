        I was a core contributor and technical project manager for
        PathCheck's Covid-19 contact tracing consumer app project. Over a
        few months, we designed, developed and shipped a the application to
        7 states and countries, which had millions of downloads and helped
        fight Covid-19.

        <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-700">
        A fast-paced mobile game of real-time Chess that is Chess without turns, built
        with React Native. It's about 90% done at this point, so there are some rough
        edges, but it's fun for a few minutes.
